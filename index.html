      <p>So, let’s find you the right instrument. Even a short search can uncover a wide range of terminology and options that can be a little daunting. We’re here to help. This page will give you all the knowledge you need for choosing a piano or keyboard that is right for you.</p>
      <p>Let’s start by splitting your options into three categories:</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="The_Three_Main_Types">
      <header><code>The Three Main Types</code></header>
      <p>Digital Keyboards</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conveniently sized, Affordable, and Versatile</li>
        <li>Sound quality and feel not as good as Acoustic Piano</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Digital Pianos</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As versatile as a keyboards while mimicking the feel acoustic pianos</li>
        <li>Larger and more expensive than a digital keyboards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Acoustic Pianos</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The best option for playing experience and sound quality</li>
        <li>By far the largest and most expensive option</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Digital_Keyboards">
      <header><code>Digital Keyboards</code></header>
      <p>A keyboard is the most minimal option, just a casing around the keys and controls. This makes it portable and usually the cheapest option. You may also see it called an “electronic” or “electric” keyboard because the sound is either synthesized or sampled. It comes from an in-built speaker with adjustable volume (or a headphone input if you don’t want to disturb).
      </p>
      <p>Digital keyboards don’t need maintenance, and you can almost always choose to play with a range of instrument sounds: pianos, organs, or non-keyboard instruments like strings. The sound quality on cheaper, older keyboards isn’t great, but modern models are pretty good.</p>
      <p>A downside of digital keyboards is that the playing experience can vary from excellent to not-so-good based on two key factors: the number of keys and the type of key action.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Digital_Pianos">
      <header><code>Digital Pianos</code></header>
      <p>Digital pianos give the convenience and flexibility of a keyboard while recreating the playing experience of an acoustic piano very well, especially as technology keeps improving. They usually have hammer action keys (see Key action guide above) and are made of wood or an imitation material. This gives you the feel of playing a solid instrument, while they don’t require tuning or the same physical maintenance as an acoustic piano.</p>
      <p>Like a digital keyboard, the sound is either synthetic or sampled, and like a digital keyboard, this gives you a range of piano and other instrument sounds. Unlike many digital keyboards, they have the full 88 keys, so you won’t limit what you can play (see Number of keys above).</p>
      <p>One downside is that while they vary in size and shape, and are smaller than their acoustic counterparts, they are not easily portable. So if you go for one of these, then you may need to experiment with where to place it at home. In general, digital pianos are more expensive than keyboards, but far cheaper than the equivalent acoustic piano.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Acoustic_Pianos">
      <header><code>Acoustic Pianos</code></header>
      <p>The original sound and playing experience that has shaped Western music for centuries. As you play, you can feel the notes resonate up through your fingers and around the room. This “acoustic” sound is created with entirely physical parts, so no electronics, sampling, or loudspeakers are involved.</p>
      <p>The downside of acoustic pianos is that they are the most expensive option by far, and the expense is not limited to buying. Moving a piano is costly, and they need maintenance. The parts react to small changes in moisture or temperature, so acoustic pianos need regular tuning. This also means you need to consider where you place an acoustic piano. They can’t be kept in damp conditions or too close to a radiator as they can easily dry out and warp.
      </p>
      <p>High-quality pianos hold their value well, so you might see it as an investment. The flipside is that you should be careful of cheap, used instruments, as a “bargain” is often damaged and expensive to repair. You should always get an opinion from someone with expertise before buying any instrument, but this is especially critical for used pianos. Also, if you’re set on an acoustic piano but aren’t sure whether you want to learn in the long term, there is a range of options available online for renting a piano or hiring out a practice room with a piano.</p>
